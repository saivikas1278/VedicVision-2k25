# Fixes for VedicVision-2K25 Application

## Icon Import Issue Fix

The application was using `FaCricketBall` icon which does not exist in the react-icons/fa package. The following fixes were implemented:

1. Replaced all instances of `FaCricketBall` with `FaBaseballBall` in the following files:
   - `pages/Matches/CreateMatch.js`
   - `pages/Matches/MatchesHub.js`
   - `pages/Matches/MatchDetails.js`
   - `pages/Matches/Scoring/CricketScoring.js`

2. Added missing `FaPlay` icon import to `pages/Matches/Scoring/CricketScoring.js`

## Variable Definition Fix

3. Fixed undefined `innings` variable in `pages/Matches/Scoring/CricketScoring.js` by replacing it with `currentInnings`

## Remaining Warnings

The application still has some ESLint warnings about unused variables and dependencies, but these don't prevent the app from running correctly. These warnings include:

- Unused icon imports in several files
- Missing dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
- Other unused variables in different components

If needed, these warnings can be fixed by:
- Removing unused imports
- Adding missing dependencies to useEffect hooks
- Removing or using declared variables

## Mock Data Fix

There is a warning about missing `../mock/authState` in the redux slices folder. This is likely because the mock data file path has changed or the file doesn't exist. This would require further investigation if it causes authentication issues.
